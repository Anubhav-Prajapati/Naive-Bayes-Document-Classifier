Naive-Bayes-Document-Classifier
===============================

Document Classification in python with some help from the Natural Language Toolkit, using a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and experimenting with various feature selectors, till now only Mutual Information.

 NaiveBayes
 
 The ' NaiveBayes.py' implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier without using feature selection and without using 
 any kind of processing help from the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).
