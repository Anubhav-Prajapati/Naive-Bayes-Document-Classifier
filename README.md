Naive-Bayes-Document-Classifier
===============================

Document Classification in python with some help from the Natural Language Toolkit, using a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and experimenting with various feature selectors, till now only Mutual Information.

 NaiveBayes
 
 The ' NaiveBayes.py' implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier without using feature selection and without using 
 any kind of processing help from the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).

 Processing Text with Natural Language Toolkit:
 
 http://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html
 
The processing tasks include:

a) Getting the category to document mapping.

b) Splitting the dataset into training set and test set.

c) Tokenization: Splitting the raw text from each document into tokens, for documents in both training dataset and test dataset.
